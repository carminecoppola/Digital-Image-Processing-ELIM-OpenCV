# ELIM Repository - Parthenope University

Welcome to the Image Processing Repository (ELIM) edited by Carmine Coppola, enrolled at the Parthenope University of Naples! This repository is dedicated to the exercises and implementations of the algorithms developed during the Image Processing course.
## Course Description

The Image Processing course focuses on the application of techniques and algorithms for manipulation, analysis, and processing of digital images. Throughout the course, topics covered include:

- Fundamentals of digital images
- Spatial and frequency domain filters
- Fourier transforms
- Segmentation and shape recognition
- Feature extraction
- Image compression
- Color image processing
- Specific applications such as computer vision, video processing, etc.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/exercises**: Contains exercises assigned during the course, categorized by topic. Each exercise is accompanied by a description and, if applicable, a set of sample data.
- **/implementations**: Includes implementations of discussed algorithms during lectures. This section is divided into subfolders corresponding to the covered topics. Each implementation is accompanied by well-commented source code and an explanation of the key algorithm steps.
- **/resources**: Contains additional resources such as presentations, articles, or guides that may be helpful for further understanding the discussed concepts during the course.
