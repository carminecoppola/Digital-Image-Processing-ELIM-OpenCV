## Course Description
The Image Processing course focuses on the application of techniques and algorithms for manipulation, analysis, and processing of digital images. Throughout the course, topics covered include:

Fundamentals of digital images
- Spatial and frequency domain filters
- Fourier transforms
- Segmentation and shape recognition
- Feature extraction
- Image compression
- Color image processing
- Specific applications such as computer vision, video processing, etc.
- Repository Structure
- The repository is organized as follows:

## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Canny**: Edge detection using the Canny algorithm.
2. **Harris**: Corner detection using the Harris detector.
3. **Hough Lines**: Line detection using the Hough transform algorithm.
4. **Hough Circles**: Circle detection using the Hough transform algorithm.
5. **Region Growing**: Image segmentation using the Region Growing algorithm.
6. **Otsu/Ostu2k/OstuEdge**: Image binarization using the Otsu algorithm in various configurations.
7. **Split&Merge**: Image segmentation using the Split&Merge algorithm.
8. **K-Means**: Image segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Installation
You need to install OpenCV to run the exercises in this repository. You can follow the appropriate instructions for your operating system from the official OpenCV website: [https://opencv.org/](https://opencv.org/)

## Usage
To run the exercises in the repository, execute the `compile.zsh` script. Make sure you have OpenCV correctly installed on your system before running the exercises.

## Structure
- `/algorithms`: Includes implementations of discussed algorithms during lectures. This section is divided into subfolders corresponding to the covered topics. Each implementation is accompanied by well-commented source code and an explanation of the key algorithm steps.
- `/img`: Contains the images for testing.
- `/exercises`: Contains exercises assigned during the course, categorized by topic. Each exercise is accompanied by a description and, if applicable, a set of sample data.
- `/training`: There is a section within the repository dedicated to exercises for the written assignment of the Image Processing course at Parthenope University. This section provides study materials and exercises for your learning.

## Collaboration
Contributions and improvements from students and professionals interested in image processing are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests with enhancements, bug fixes, or new features.
