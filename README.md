## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Canny**: Edge detection using the Canny algorithm.
2. **Harris**: Corner detection using the Harris detector.
3. **Hough Lines**: Line detection using the Hough transform algorithm.
4. **Hough Circles**: Circle detection using the Hough transform algorithm.
5. **Region Growing**: Image segmentation using the Region Growing algorithm.
6. **Otsu/Ostu2k/OstuEdge**: Image binarization using the Otsu algorithm in various configurations.
7. **Split&Merge**: Image segmentation using the Split&Merge algorithm.
8. **K-Means**: Image segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Installation
You need to install OpenCV to run the exercises in this repository. You can follow the appropriate instructions for your operating system from the official OpenCV website: [https://opencv.org/](https://opencv.org/)

## Usage
To run the exercises in the repository, execute the `compile.zsh` script. Make sure you have OpenCV correctly installed on your system before running the exercises.

## Training Section
There is a section within the repository dedicated to exercises for the written assignment of the Image Processing course at Parthenope University. This section provides study materials and exercises for your learning.

## Collaboration
Contributions and improvements from students and professionals interested in image processing are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests with enhancements, bug fixes, or new features.
